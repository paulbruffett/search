Having gone to 3 other elementary schools (the last one definitely not being my favorite), it was a big relief for me having attended this school in my last year of elementary. I can definitely see why they\\'re rated the best public elementary school in Washington...they really live up to their fame. There\\'s a lot of good diversity, the students are super nice and friendly, the teachers are so helpful, and the staff is just so kind. Only thing I\\'d change would be the separation of Quest (Gifted) and GenEd (general education.) Having been a Quest student myself, I can definitely tell you that while socializing, Questies hang out with mostly other Questies and vice versa. In fact, I don\\'t think I had even one GenEd friend the whole school year. Overall this is such an amazing school. I definitely recommend it, and it\\'s tied for my favorite elementary school I went to (which is surprising since I went to top-rated schools a lot.)...

The school is relatively new, so the area is nicer than other schools. I was part of both regular and Quest programs, and I have had mixed experiences in both. Some teachers motivate the students to do well, while others care more about making the students feel happy but do not approach studies seriously. I hear there are more activities and club opportunities, but mostly in a new school, there aren\\'t many activities where students take leadership and opportunities to do things. COVID caused many extracurricular opportunities to go away, so I would assume the school is building back up on those things. The food is similar to the other elementary schools in the district, which isn\\'t very appealing. The community is respectful and wealthy, just like most places in Education Hill. This school is fine for what a standard elementary school provides in a growing environment for the Eastside....

Our daughter is highly creative and can demonstrate her learning in the most imaginative and unique ways that end up being more meaningful for her than standardized tests and essays. The sense of community and connection is also impressive, given that it is an online school. Through a variety of clubs, homeroom classes, and caring advisers to meet with every week, a student always has the opportunity to feel supported and a sense of belonging. Thank you, CMASAS!...

Then slightly less so the last few years with some staff moving to new schools which recently opened near by. However, it\\'s added some new wonderful leaders to join the gems still there. I\\'m very excited to see it begin to blossom again. The PTSA is strong, and highly involved with many programs available from art, STEM, music, clubs, national competitions, advanced students opportunities, and hopefully a return of the outstanding drama program! There is a multitude of after school activities such as Boys & Girls Club They orchestrate events such as the science fair, international night (which is amazing to see SO MANY diverse backgrounds celebrated), reading night, back to school parties, which often draw older siblings back. They even have an active Mascot (parent/teacher in costume). fyi, they constantly integrate strong character building, largely based on Rosa Parks.

Everyone is welcome. If there is one thing to change, however, it would be my experience in the arts. Theatre is truly something that has changed my life and performing at Eastlake in its many shows is a part of my daily life, but our school treats our arts departments with relatively great neglect in comparison with other extracurriculars such as sports - like football. This year, even, teachers from the arts department in our school are being fired and clubs, such as Choir Club, are being shut down without hesitation.

Despite being a small school of roughly 400 attendees, I have never felt closer to home with the people I am always around.

The academics are strong, and the pressure to succeed is real. But one big downside is how closed-off the school has been. Until this year, you had to live on Mercer Island to attend, which led to a lack of diversity and culture. As someone who moved from Austria and has switched schools before, I’m pretty social — but even I found it hard to fit in at first. I can\\'t imagine how tough it’d be for someone less outgoing. I\\'m grateful for the education, but I do wish I had gone to a different school earlier, maybe in Seattle, to experience more fun and balance.

I truly enjoyed coming to school each day and I felt like I was genuinely learning rather than just wasting my day being taught things I already knew. It was challenging, but in a good way. The only critique I may have is that the school seems to be very worried about lawsuits and getting sued, so they often make odd decisions that don’t put the children’s best interest at mind.

Every class that I\\'ve been a part of has had a very realistic and accessible path to success as well as a teacher that was willing to help me get there. Of course, I didn\\'t always get perfect scores but I truly believe that those struggles came from mistakes on my part, with the teachers consistently offering ways to learn from those short comings. Although I love the academic aspect of my school, I think that our culture lacks in personability and welcomeness. Most students are polite, but not many are caring.

Before I committed to SHS I was accepted into two local prep schools. While my freshman year was good, I still battled with thoughts of \"what if I had gone to the prep schools?\" By the time Sophomore year rolled around I was committed to SHS in full and cherishing every moment therein. I never realized that turning down sought after prep schools would be such a great decision, but I am so glad I went to SHS instead.

Additionally, the school has a College and Career Center to help students looking for help in their lives beyond high school. Generally speaking, the teachers are effective and contribute to a good school environment. Unfortunately, there have been problem teachers that, despite multiple complaints, remain at the school due to slow administrative action. Luckily, students generally have the option to transfer to a different class. Another problem, though, is that the school is not consistent in providing feminine hygiene products in every bathroom, especially throughout the day. Some bathrooms are bare and others are stocked with one but not the other. Finally, I do wish the school provided more updates and notifications on things like the SAT and other college preparedness topics.

I benefitted from having to opportunity to take rigorous science and math classes like AP Physics C: Mechanics, honors Geometry, and honors Algebra II. However, one of the challenges with the school district is the struggles with funding as student attendance continues to drop. Therefore, there is a shrinkage of the elective classes as there are not enough teachers nor students who are able to fill the classes. Though after Covid occurred, most high schools have been struggling with regaining student attendance numbers. A change to Bainbridge High School that I would like to see would be to increase the involvement in school clubs by having all clubs be represented on the school website and mandated to participate in club fairs....

The school is strong academically and its sports teams are fine considering being a small private school. Students are generally motivated and subsequently perform well on APs and SAT/ACT tests. The facilities are constantly being improved, and the school campus is lovely. The school does struggle to keep its students from focusing solely on grades, although that is equally the fault of the college admissions system as it is the fault of the school. This school and its atmosphere would not suit a student who doesn\\'t care about their academics or one who doesn\\'t thrive in competitive environments. Also, the food is generally bad. Though that doesn\\'t take away from the school as a whole....

It is a warm and welcoming campus making for an easy transition. As a college prep curriculum, instructors designed thoughtful and carefully prepared instruction, assignments, and assessments which were intended not only to convey information, but also to stimulate curiosity, discussion, and understanding. My son found most all the instructors to be supportive and responsive. Ironically, despite being surrounded by many of the wealthiest families in Seattle: the community’s acceptance did much for his self confidence, which in the past, local school bullies had challenged. I did hear from a friend with a daughter that attended, girls have a different experience than boys. She felt the girls were highly competitive and her daughter experienced debilitating stress. I’m not sure if this is a universal response, or a combination of factors. But my son really thrived at Lakeside....

I have always loved the school, teachers, and the academics. Bear Creek is a very academically rigorous school, but it lends itself to having teachers that build trust with the students so that students feel comfortable to ask for assistance when stuck. They are always prepared for what might come, one big example is when Covid hit, within two weeks of having to stay home, we were already in online learning. It was a struggle, but just like in-person, teachers were gracious as we were all learning to navigate together. Bear Creek has been my second home for the majority of my life, building a face and comforting community that I know that I will always be able to lean on for support even as I ready myself for the future....

He was able to make a nice group of friends, and I am very impressed with the outstanding quality of the teachers and all areas of curriculum, from STEM to humanities to arts. I feel my son is really learning how to think analytically and creatively. The class sizes are small, allowing for the students to really be engaged. The academic standards are very high, but the homework load is manageable, and the teachers make themselves available to provide extra support if needed. The campus is beautiful, safe, and very well-maintained. Plus, there are so many opportunities to get involved as a parent (but no pressure to do so), as well as several community-building events throughout the year.

During the pandemic when all of the schools shut down, we were left to homeschool our children. Until we found out that Pacific Christian Academy was to remain open. We quickly enrolled our children, and we couldn\\'t be happier. Our daughter had anxiety and would cry at every single drop off, but the pre-kindergarten teacher was so patient and kind to our daughter. She worked with us to provide the right tools during drop offs to make it less traumatic. I love that the teachers pray for each child if they got hurt. I love the value that Pacific Christian Academy upholds. I have no doubt that my children will continue to grow in their faith. Thank you, Pacific Christian Academy, for providing our children with the bible-based tools to overcome any challenges they might face in the \"real world.\"...

While it is a religious institution, it is open to students of all different types of cultures and religions. They use clubs and activities to encourage diversity, such as the culture week and the student unions. The student community is great socially. Academically, however, teachers can be difficult to work with as office hours and grading systems are a bit complicated. Some teachers don\\'t make themselves available to students during office hours or when responding to emails. The school counselors are eager to help people, while the administration likes to make it difficult to reach counselors in times of need.

      "\n",
      "The Seattle metropolitan region (encompassing Seattle, Bellevue, Bothell, Redmond, and adjacent suburbs) presents a diverse educational landscape with a variety of public and private schooling options. The highest-ranked school districts are located predominantly on the Eastside (Bellevue, Issaquah, Mercer Island, Northshore, and Lake Washington districts), known for strong academic performance, comprehensive extracurricular programs, and high college readiness. Within Seattle city limits, the Seattle Public Schools district offers many option schools and specialized programs but faces challenges in educational equity and academic outcomes, motivating ongoing strategic plans focused on equity and inclusivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ranking data from Niche.com (2025) positions these Eastside districts at the top with \"A+\" overall grades reflecting excellent academics, teacher quality, and graduation rates. Conversely, some districts such as Everett and Riverview lag behind with \"B+\" or \"B\" grades, often citing infrastructure or funding issues. Several themes emerge driving disparities, including socio-economic demographics, equity-focused initiatives, teacher quality, diversity, and family engagement. Families assessing school options should balance school rankings with programmatic fit, diversity, access to Spanish and dual-language immersion programs, and transportation logistics.\n",
      "\n",
      "For private schools, the Seattle metro boasts prestigious and academically rigorous institutions, such as The Overlake School, Lakeside School, University Prep, Seattle Academy, and others mainly clustered around Seattle, Bellevue, and nearby areas. These schools emphasize college preparation, smaller student-to-teacher ratios, and specialized curricula (e.g., STEM, arts, religious education), though cost is an important consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seattle Public Schools offers an open enrollment and school choice system, allowing families to apply for attendance at option schools or outside their neighborhood zones subject to availability. These systems support access to diverse programs and help families tailor choices to needs, whether public, specialized option schools, or private alternatives. Evaluation should include academic outcomes, program availability, school climate, and logistical factors such as commute and family priorities.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Bellevue School District** (Grade A+, 32 schools, ~19,000 students): Renowned for academic rigor, supportive staff, well-funded extracurriculars, and athlete prioritization. It holds highly rated high schools such as Bellevue High and several specialized programs.  \n",
      "- **Northshore School District** (Grade A+, 39 schools, ~22,900 students): High marks for diversity, strong remote learning adaptation, but some concerns over specific arts funding.  \n",
      "- **Lake Washington School District** (Grade A+, 57 schools, ~31,000 students): Praised for supportive teachers and counselors, safety, and diverse student population. Home to Tesla STEM High School, ranked #1 high school in the region by US News.  \n",
      "- **Issaquah School District** (Grade A+, 30 schools, ~19,500 students): Academically focused with an emphasis on college preparation and social responsibility.  \n",
      "- **Mercer Island School District** (Grade A, 6 schools, ~4,000 students): Smaller district with personalized attention, high academic and social-emotional support, and excellent college placements.  \n",
      "- **Bainbridge Island School District** (Grade A, 10 schools, ~3,600 students): Known for flexible and responsive teachers and competitive sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other districts with solid \"A\" or \"A-\" grades include Shoreline, Tahoma, Vashon Island, University Place, Snoqualmie Valley, Edmonds, and Everett (the latter with slightly lower rankings and challenges).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Lower-Ranked Districts and Challenges**  \n",
      "Districts like **Everett, Riverview, Mukilteo, Sumner-Bonney Lake, and Fife** rank lower (B+ or B), with some citing funding constraints, aging facilities, and uneven program offerings. The Seattle Public Schools district, while large (109 schools, 51,000+ students), carries an overall Niche grade of A- and must address significant equity challenges and achievement gaps, particularly among students of color, as highlighted in district strategic plans.^2\n",

      "**Standouts**  \n",
      "- **Tesla STEM High School (Lake Washington SD):** #1 High School in Seattle area and ranked #3 nationally by U.S. News.^3 A specialized STEM program with 100% college readiness, strong AP participation, and modern facilities.  \n",
      "- **International School (Bellevue SD):** Integrates global curriculum with rigorous academics, ranked #2 in Seattle metro area by U.S. News.  \n",

      "**Lagging Schools/Districts**  \n",
      "- **Everett SD:** Despite a large district size and many programs, struggles with funding cuts and disparate educational outcomes.  \n",
      "- **Seattle Public Schools (SPS):** Largest district facing socio-economic disparities and achievement gaps. The district acknowledges systemic inequities affecting African American boys and students of color.  \n",
      "- **Some smaller districts and more rural areas:** May have fewer resources or specialized programs.\n",

      "**Equity and Inclusion Focus**  \n",
      "Seattle’s district strategic plans (notably Seattle Excellence 2019-2024, ongoing through 2025) emphasize reducing opportunity and achievement gaps for Students of Color, especially African American boys and teens.^2 It includes culturally responsive teaching, restorative discipline practices, and expanded family engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Academic Rigor and Curriculum**  \n",
      "High-ranking districts and schools consistently offer rigorous core academics, Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) opportunities, gifted and talented programs, and specialty schools (e.g., magnet STEM campuses).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Teacher Quality and Support**  \n",
      "Positive reviews consistently highlight caring, supportive teachers and administrators who engage with students and families, contributing directly to student success.\n",

      "**Diversity and Community Fit**  \n",
      "Diverse student populations, inclusive environments, and alignment with family values (religious, socio-economic, cultural) play a central role in school desirability and success.\n",
      "\n",

       "\n",
       "The Seattle metropolitan region (encompassing Seattle, Bellevue, Bothell, Redmond, and adjacent suburbs) presents a diverse educational landscape with a variety of public and private schooling options. The highest-ranked school districts are located predominantly on the Eastside (Bellevue, Issaquah, Mercer Island, Northshore, and Lake Washington districts), known for strong academic performance, comprehensive extracurricular programs, and high college readiness. Within Seattle city limits, the Seattle Public Schools district offers many option schools and specialized programs but faces challenges in educational equity and academic outcomes, motivating ongoing strategic plans focused on equity and inclusivity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ranking data from Niche.com (2025) positions these Eastside districts at the top with \"A+\" overall grades reflecting excellent academics, teacher quality, and graduation rates. Conversely, some districts such as Everett and Riverview lag behind with \"B+\" or \"B\" grades, often citing infrastructure or funding issues. Several themes emerge driving disparities, including socio-economic demographics, equity-focused initiatives, teacher quality, diversity, and family engagement. Families assessing school options should balance school rankings with programmatic fit, diversity, access to Spanish and dual-language immersion programs, and transportation logistics.\n",
       "\n",
       "For private schools, the Seattle metro boasts prestigious and academically rigorous institutions, such as The Overlake School, Lakeside School, University Prep, Seattle Academy, and others mainly clustered around Seattle, Bellevue, and nearby areas. These schools emphasize college preparation, smaller student-to-teacher ratios, and specialized curricula (e.g., STEM, arts, religious education), though cost is an important consideration.\n",
       "\n",
       "Seattle Public Schools offers an open enrollment and school choice system, allowing families to apply for attendance at option schools or outside their neighborhood zones subject to availability. These systems support access to diverse programs and help families tailor choices to needs, whether public, specialized option schools, or private alternatives. Evaluation should include academic outcomes, program availability, school climate, and logistical factors such as commute and family priorities.\n",
